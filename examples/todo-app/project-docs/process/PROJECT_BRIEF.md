# Project Brief: React Todo App

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a simple, intuitive todo application using React that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application will provide a clean user interface with modern design elements using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS.

### Target Users
- Individuals looking for a straightforward task management solution
- Users who need to organize their daily activities
- People who prefer a minimalist, easy-to-use interface

### Success Metrics
- User can successfully create, edit, and delete tasks
- Tasks persist between browser sessions
- UI is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices
- All features are accessible and intuitive to use

## Features and Functionality

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- **Task Management**:
  - Create new tasks with a title and optional description
  - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
  - Edit existing tasks
  - Delete tasks
  - Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed)

- **User Interface**:
  - Clean, responsive design using shadcn/ui components
  - Dark/light mode toggle
  - Visual indicators for task status

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Store tasks in local storage
  - Retrieve tasks on page load

### Phase 2 (Future Enhancements)
- Task categories/tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Task priority levels
- Drag and drop reordering
- User accounts and cloud synchronization

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Context API for state management
- Local Storage API for data persistence

### Development Tools
- Vite for fast development and building
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- Git for version control
