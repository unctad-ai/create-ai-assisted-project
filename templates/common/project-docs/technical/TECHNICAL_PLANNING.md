# Technical Implementation Planning

This document provides guidance on creating effective technical implementation plans for this project.

## What is a Technical Implementation Plan?

A detailed blueprint that translates project requirements into specific technical implementation steps. It bridges the gap between the "what" (project brief) and the "how" (code implementation).

## Components of a Good Plan

### 1. Data Models & Schema

- Define all entities/models with their fields and types
- Specify relationships between models
- Document validation rules
- Example:
  ```typescript
  interface User {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
    role: 'admin' | 'user';
    createdAt: Date;
  }
  ```

### 2. API/Interface Definitions

- Define all endpoints/functions with:
  - Inputs/parameters
  - Return types
  - Error states
  - Authentication requirements
- Example:
  ```typescript
  // GET /api/users/:id
  function getUser(id: string): Promise<User | null>
  ```

### 3. Component Structure

- List all UI components needed
- Define component props and state
- Specify component hierarchy
- Identify reusable components
- Example:
  ```
  - UserDashboard
    - UserProfile
      - AvatarUpload
      - ProfileForm
    - ActivityFeed
      - ActivityItem
  ```

### 4. Libraries and Dependencies

- List all external libraries needed
- Justify each library's inclusion
- Note any compatibility concerns
- Example:
  ```
  - react-query: For server state management
  - zod: For runtime type validation
  - date-fns: For date formatting and manipulation
  ```

### 5. Architecture Decisions

- Document key architectural choices
- Explain the reasoning behind each decision
- Consider alternatives and why they were rejected
- Example:
  ```
  Decision: Use React Query for data fetching
  Reasoning: Provides caching, polling, and error handling with minimal boilerplate
  Alternatives: SWR (less feature-rich), custom fetch hooks (more maintenance)
  ```

### 6. Implementation Sequence

- Break down implementation into ordered steps
- Identify dependencies between steps
- Estimate complexity of each step
- Example:
  ```
  1. Create database schema (1 day)
  2. Implement API endpoints (2 days)
  3. Build UI components (3 days)
  4. Connect UI to API (1 day)
  5. Add authentication (2 days)
  ```

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing your plan, verify:

- All requirements are addressed
- Data flow is clearly defined
- Error handling is considered
- Edge cases are identified
- Security concerns are addressed
- Performance implications are understood
- Testing strategy is outlined

## Converting Plan to Tasks

Once your technical plan is complete, convert it to tasks in todo.md:

1. Break down each section into discrete tasks
2. Ensure each task has clear acceptance criteria
3. Organize tasks by priority and dependencies
4. Add tasks to todo.md in the appropriate sections

Remember: Iterate on the technical plan at least 3-5 times before finalizing it.
