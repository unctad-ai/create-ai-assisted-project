## Extended Templates (When Needed)

### Technical Planning Details

```
Let's design the technical architecture for: [feature/component].

Consider:
- Data models and state management
- Component structure and relationships
- API endpoints and data flow
- Performance considerations
```

### Task Breakdown Prompt

```
Let's break down this feature into smaller tasks:
[Feature description]

Create tasks that:
- Can be completed in a single session
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Follow a logical implementation sequence
```

### Documentation Creation

```
Help me document [component/feature], including:
- Purpose and functionality
- Usage examples
- API/props reference
- Edge cases and limitations
```

### Progress Update

```
Let's update memory.md with our recent progress on:
[List of completed items]

Include:
- What was implemented
- Technical decisions made
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Next steps
```

## Best Practices

- Keep prompts simple and focused
- One major task per session
- Always update memory.md with progress
- Follow test-driven development
- Use the simplest prompt that gets the job done
